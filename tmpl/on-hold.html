                            <li><p>Inability to find a certain niche to focus on, leads found so far had various bespoke requirements which wasted time and resources from the core product, some examples: pixel perfect web design, specific pdf layouts and formats, computer vision integration, rule based expert system-like logic</p></li>
                            <li><p>Internal app builder market as well as web builder market are already very crowded ... FormulaDB aims to offer business users with unique features like implementing ACID guarantees and consistency through a simple friendly interface: validation formulas and auto-correction formulas, however are not proven to appeal to a large enough market</p></li>
                            <li><p>LLM/generative-AI advancements triggered a gold rush for natural language driven assistance, visual builders need to be evaluated in this new context.</p></li>
